# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

Analzying kickstarter data to understand what factors lead to a higher rate of success for a theatre kickstarter campaign. We narrowed down the search to the U.S. and we see that, in the first graph, a good time to start a campaign would be in Qtr 2 (roughly around June). The number of successful projects decreases as their launch date starts closer to the end of the year. In the second graph, we are able to see that there are more successful campaigns for theatre.

We have found the country, category and when the launch date should be. Now, let us take a closer look at what is an attainable budget for a theatre campaign.

|         |	Successful	| Failed |
----------|-------------|--------|
|Mean Goal|	  $5,049| $10,554|
|Median Goal| $3,000|  $5,000|
|Standard Deviation of Goal|	$7,749|	$21,968|
|Upper Quartile of Goal|	$5,000|	$10,000|
|Lower Quartile of Goal|	$1,500|$2,000|
|IQR of Goal|	$3,500|	$8,000|
|           |       |       |    		
|Mean Pledged|	$5,602|	$559|
|Median Pledged|	$3,168|	$103|
|Standard Deviation of Pledged|	$8,335|	$1,331|
|Upper Quartile of Pledged|	$5,699|	$501|
|Lower Quartile of Pledged|	$1,717|	$9|
|IQR of Pledged|	$3,982|	$492|


As we take a closer look at the table above, the mean for both goal and pledged are greater than the median. This means that the distribution is skewed more to the left. As such, campaigns with a higher goal has a higher chance for failure.

### Recommendations
For a higher chance of a successful kickstarter, we advise the following:
* Start the campaign in June
* Theatre campaigns are more successful
* Have you goal under $10,000.00
